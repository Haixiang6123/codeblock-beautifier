A chrome extension for highlighting codes of [Medium](https://medium.com/) Articles, but now, it can highlight codes in any websites that have `<pre/>` element.

## Purpose
The main reason I built it is because [Medium](www.medium.com) doesn't highlight our codes.
Well, I know there are several ways to embed codes in the articles, but some people (like me) don't wanna create a gist or codesandbox project to highlight the codes. So most of time, I see this 🙄:

What I expect is like this 😄:

![Highlight](screenshot/highlight.png)

So I built an extension to beautify code blocks in [Medium](www.medium.com).

It can also be used for other websites that contain `<pre/>`.
The only thing you need to do is to press the "Parse" button!

## Future
There may have some problems that I haven't found for this extension yet. If you have any questions or find any bugs, please put an issue on this repo. Thank you!
